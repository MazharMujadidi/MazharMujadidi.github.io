								<h2>HOME OFFICE – MANSTON NATIONAL RECEPTION CENTRE</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Managing a £500 million project for the Ministry of Justice,
commissioned by the Home Office who are the end clients,
to establish a new National Reception Centre Facility within
the Manston Site.</li>
									<li>Demonstrated exceptional project management skills by
effectively handling Requests for information (RFIs), including
the resolution of over 100 open and outdated RFIs upon
joining the project. Coordination with different teams and the
client led to their closure, resulting in increased efficiency. This
proactive approach significantly reduced costs, particularly
in design-related decision-making processes.</li>
									<li>Oversaw several surveys being undertaken on site and coordinated them with the simultaneous
demolitions works being undertaken, efficiently programming both duties. Expertly managed various
discipline subconsultants, including MEP, Architectural, BIM, Ecology, and more, fostering seamless
collaboration and optimizing project outcomes.</li>
									<li>Contributed to the overall success of the project, achieving key milestones and delivering exceptional
Project Management services to meet client expectations.</li>
	
								</ul>
								<h2>ROYAL MAIL GROUP</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Successfully managing multiple projects in collaboration with Royal Mail, focusing on MEP, working at
height, and fabric works for numerous delivery offices.</li>
<li>Played a key role in project initiation, including tendering process and conducting On-site pre-start
meetings to align on scope, schedule, and safety. By maintaining records, I have achieved success in
mitigating costs associated with complications arising from matters discussed during the meetings,
ensuring efficient project management and effective issue resolution. Additionally, my scrutiny of
contractor variations against their original pricing documents and preliminaries has resulted in significant
cost savings for the projects I managed.</li>
<li>Facilitated successful project handover meetings, ensuring seamless transition and client satisfaction.
These handovers demonstrated that a strong commitment to compliance with RMG standards and British
regulations were met through the duration of the project.</li>

								</ul>

<h2>Ministry of Justice - HMCTs Courts</h2>
								<ul>
									<li> Worked on multiple Court Projects for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). These Projects include 
HMCTs Brighton Court, Lewes Court, and Hove Court which have a value of £5.3m, £2.2m, 
and 2.4m, respectively.</li>
<li>Demonstrated problem solving skills by coordinating and producing a suitable programme 
which meets the client requirement of allowing the interdependent courts to continue 
business as usual during construction. Identified efficiencies to save Programme time for the 
total construction period.</li>
<li>Communicated with the client to identify their main requirements during the Developed 
Project Proposal (DPP) Stage within the Tender Period and ensured urgent matters were 
addressed during the early period of the Programme. With court temperatures reaching 40oC 
on hot days, I ensured a temporary chiller was utilised to provide Client satisfaction until later 
in the Project when the chiller replacement would commence.</li>
<li>HMCTs Hove Court, which had been previously put on hold, is expected to start on site on 
February following the completion of HMCTs Lewes Court. During this period, I have 
organised discussions between the client and contractor to discuss the project scope and 
changes to incorporate within the DPP.</li>
