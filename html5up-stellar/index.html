              <p>I am a passionate project manager with a technical background and over 2 years of experience managing a variety 
                of projects. Originally from London, I earned my Bachelors in Civil Engineering and Masters in Project 
                and Infrastructure Management. Throughout my career, I have proven to be an effective project manager
                 adept at scoping, planning, budgeting, leading teams, and delivering results on time and within budget. 
                 As a project manager, I am driven by a 
                  passion for driving progress and growth through successful project delivery. I am always looking for
                   new challenges to continue enhancing my skills as a project leader.

            <h2>HOME OFFICE – MANSTON NATIONAL RECEPTION CENTRE</h2>

            <ul class="project-item">
              <li>
                Managing a £500 million project for the Ministry of Justice,
                commissioned by the Home Office who are the end clients, to
                establish a new National Reception Centre Facility within the
                Manston Site.
              </li>
              <li>
                Demonstrated exceptional project management skills by
                effectively handling Requests for information (RFIs), including
                the resolution of over 100 open and outdated RFIs upon joining
                the project. Coordination with different teams and the client
                led to their closure, resulting in increased efficiency. This
                proactive approach significantly reduced costs, particularly in
                design-related decision-making processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Oversaw several surveys being undertaken on site and coordinated
                them with the simultaneous demolitions works being undertaken,
                efficiently programming both duties. Expertly managed various
                discipline subconsultants, including MEP, Architectural, BIM,
                Ecology, and more, fostering seamless collaboration and
                optimizing project outcomes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Contributed to the overall success of the project, achieving key
                milestones and delivering exceptional Project Management
                services to meet client expectations.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>ROYAL MAIL GROUP</h2>
            <ul class="project-item">
              <li>
                Successfully managing multiple projects in collaboration with
                Royal Mail, focusing on MEP, working at height, and fabric works
                for numerous delivery offices.
              </li>
              <li>
                Played a key role in project initiation, including tendering
                process and conducting On-site pre-start meetings to align on
                scope, schedule, and safety. By maintaining records, I have
                achieved success in mitigating costs associated with
                complications arising from matters discussed during the
                meetings, ensuring efficient project management and effective
                issue resolution. Additionally, my scrutiny of contractor
                variations against their original pricing documents and
                preliminaries has resulted in significant cost savings for the
                projects I managed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Facilitated successful project handover meetings, ensuring
                seamless transition and client satisfaction. These handovers
                demonstrated that a strong commitment to compliance with RMG
                standards and British regulations were met through the duration
                of the project.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Ministry of Justice - HMCTs Courts</h2>
            <ul class="project-item">
              <li>
                Worked on multiple Court Projects for the Ministry of Justice
                (MoJ). These Projects include HMCTs Brighton Court, Lewes Court,
                and Hove Court which have a value of £5.3m, £2.2m, and 2.4m,
                respectively.
              </li>
              <li>
                Demonstrated problem solving skills by coordinating and
                producing a suitable programme which meets the client
                requirement of allowing the interdependent courts to continue
                business as usual during construction. Identified efficiencies
                to save Programme time for the total construction period.
              </li>
              <li>
                Communicated with the client to identify their main requirements
                during the Developed Project Proposal (DPP) Stage within the
                Tender Period and ensured urgent matters were addressed during
                the early period of the Programme. With court temperatures
                reaching 40oC on hot days, I ensured a temporary chiller was
                utilised to provide Client satisfaction until later in the
                Project when the chiller replacement would commence.
              </li>
              <li>
                HMCTs Hove Court, which had been previously put on hold, is
                expected to start on site on February following the completion
                of HMCTs Lewes Court. During this period, I have organised
                discussions between the client and contractor to discuss the
                project scope and changes to incorporate within the DPP.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Ministry of Justice - HMP East Sutton Park</h2>
            <ul class="project-item">
              <li>
                HMP East Sutton Park is an open prison and young offender
                institution (YOI) for women aged 18 and over. I have been
                involved in two projects within this Site – Asbestos Containing
                Materials (ACM) Roof Replacement (£600k) and Fire Safety
                Improvements (FSI).
              </li>
              <li>
                FSI Project - Due to the complications of the main building, I
                had consulted the team and proposed that an engineered approach
                be taken, fully identifying the fabric components and structural
                details to develop accurate options which can be presented to
                the clients. This has led to the progression of the project,
                where I have taken on the role of organising the necessary
                surveying works and assisting with the next steps of the
                project.
              </li>
              <li>
                My involvement in the ACM Roof Replacement project began during
                the tender stage, having been provided a Direct Award to the
                Contractor. The Contractors Tender Submission was refused as it
                did not prove value for money. To Proceed, I recommended that
                the roof conditions be reviewed to determine the urgency of this
                project, thus assisting us in understanding the next steps. We
                have learnt from the previous submission and have recommended
                exploring different Procurement options which better match the
                requirements for this project.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities</h2>
            <ul class="project-item">
              <li>
                I have delivered several DLUHC projects, providing a Client-Side
                support role (CSSP) for Homeowners making applications for
                funding towards eligible works.
              </li>
              <li>
                I led the Red Review Scheme, which involved assessing a sum of
                30 individual projects/applications to determine whether
                intervention would be required. I successfully collaborated with
                the other CSSP’s to schedule meetings for these 30 applicants
                within a short period. The Red Review was a great success which
                I had accelerated, resolving the task ahead of the given
                deadline.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Portsmouth City Centre – Highways</h2>
            <ul class="project-item">
              <li>
                The SEHRT Scheme is made up of 3 highways projects: City Centre
                North, City Centre South and Lake Road. I have provided a
                commercial assistant role on this project, developing my NEC4
                knowledge and assisting in contractual agreements, such as the
                PSC
              </li>
              <li>
                To ensure Client needs are fulfilled, I chair bi-weekly meetings
                between AtkinsRéalis and PCC ahead of our commercial meetings.
                Additionally, I have kept all of the commercial documents up to
                date including a Compensation Events spreadsheet which I present
                on the Commercial Calls. This provides value as it allows us to
                simply run through each outstanding CE item, and determine who
                this sits with to close out.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>
              Department for Education – Oak Academy & Isle of Wight College
            </h2>
            <ul class="project-item">
              <li>
                I have administered DfE projects at different stages. I provided
                a PM role for Oak Academy during the tender stage. Provided
                support and lead on key items for contract close, including
                Derogations, Contractors Proposals, Programme, Contract, and
                cost plans.
              </li>
              <li>
                Additionally, I’ve provided supportive duties for the Isle of
                Wight College, including but not limited to managing the survey
                programme, arranging access and assisting during feasibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                Took responsibility for approaching contractors and gather
                quotes for the IOW College Asbestos Management Survey. I
                investigated the competitive market and consequently worked with
                another contractor, causing an 80% deduction to the Client costs
                for this service. The selected Contractor had conducted these
                works with great success.
